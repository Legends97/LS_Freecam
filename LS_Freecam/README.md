## Overview
This script enables a free camera mode in FiveM that allows players to take screenshots or record videos. 
The camera can move freely within a configurable range and zoom in and out. 
It also includes controls for rolling (tilting) the camera.

## Features
* Free Camera Movement: Move the camera in any direction within a configurable range.
* Camera Zoom: Use the scroll wheel or Page Up/Down keys to zoom in and out.
* Camera Roll: Tilt the camera using the arrow keys.
* Customizable: Easily configure the camera's range, movement speed, and more.
